                    <p class="lead">I worked on a mobile game with a startup company, <a href="http://deviousgamers.com" target="_blank">Devious Gamers</a>. We were
                    quite possibly some of the first people to develop a commercial game using Unreal Engine 4. The game spent a few years in development hell before
                    finally being released in 2016.</p>

                    This web app can match you with other Dota 2 players who are compatible with your schedule, skills, and play style. Players
                    can match one-on-one or create optimal teams.</p>

                    I still might finish this one someday.</p>

<!-- Hi. I hacked this webpage together for a school project
     and didn't have time to make the site responsive. So if
     you are wondering why this page looks like trash on
	 mobile devices, wonder no more. I will probably fix this
	 at some point. Until then, tilt your phone sideways or
	 view this on a pc.

						<h3>What is software?</h3>
						<p>You are using software right now to view this website.  You probably already know what software is, and may refer to it as an app or a program.
						You use software everyday to send emails, write documents, browse the internet, play computer games, and more.						
						</p><br>
					</div>
				
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>What do you mean, free?</h3>
						<p>It may sound confusing, but free software does not mean free of cost.  On the contrary, free software means free as in freedom.
						When you use free software there are no restrictions involved. Free software ensures a number of freedoms to you
						when you use it.  You are free to use it however you want, share it with whoever you want, and modify it to do whatever you want.

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Use Software However You Want</h3>
						<p>There are no restrictions with how you can use free software. You may use the software on any computer you want.
						There is no time limit on how long you are able to use the software. You get to control what you do with the software,
						not the corporation that made it.
						</p><br>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Share Software With Whoever You Want</h3>
						<p>With free software, you are free to share a copy with a friend, family member, or stranger. You may share the software
						with as few or as many people as you like. If you share free software with someone, they are entitled to all the same freedoms
						that you were.
						</p><br>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Modify Software To Do What You Want</h3>
						<p>If you are not a programmer, it is unlikely that you will be able to modify free software yourself. Don't let that stop you!
						You can make requests to programmers to improve the software you use. It is easier than you might think. It is very common for free software
						to have online communities where you can make requests.

						<h3>You Get Better Software</h3>
						<p>Software that isn't free software is worked on only by the corporation that owns it. The number of people who are
							able to improve it is limited.  This is not the case for free software.  There are no restrictions on who can work
							on free software, so programmers all over the world are able to make improvements. Since the programmers working on
							free software are often users as well, they are dedicated to make the software better. With so many eyes on the software,
							it will be less buggy.
						
						</p><br>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>You Get Trustworthy Software</h3>
						<p>Free software is inspected by programmers all over the world. These programmers aren't just improving the software, they are auditing it as well.
						Not all programmers are honest about the software they make. Some software will claim to do one thing, but do something else you don't expect.
						It might play music like it's supposed to, but it's secretly spying on you and stealing your credit card information.  <br>This kind of thing doesn't happen with free software.
						If the software does anything it's not supposed to, it won't be long before someone finds out. The transparency of free software keeps programmers honest, which leads to more
						trustworthy software.

						<h3>What is Non-Free Software?</h3>
						<p>Non-free software is restrictive. You are not gaurenteed the freedom to use non-free software any way you want, share it with anyone you want,
						or modify it to do what you want. The corporation that makes the software tells you what you can and can't do with it.

						<h3>Invasion of Privacy</h3>
						<p>Non-free software might be spying on you without you knowing it. Since it is not possible to inspect non-free software,
						it is very difficult to know what it is doing behind the scenes. It may be snooping through your personal data and collecting
						information to sell to advertisers.
						</p><br>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Security Issues</h3>
						<p>The creators of non-free software might leave backdoors in their software.  A backdoor is a hole left in software
						security so that it can later be used to gain access to a computer without the users knowledge. It's bad enough that the
						programmer who created that backdoor could gain access to your computer, but if a clever hacker discovered the backdoor, they
						would be able to gain access too.<br>
						Since it is not possible to inspect non-free software, it can be very difficult to know whether there are backdoors hidden in it.
						Even if they are discovered, they can not be removed, because non-free software cannot be modified.

				<h1><b>Examples</b></h1>
				<br>
				
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Spotify</h3>
						<p>It was discovered that the music app, Spotify, was spying on it's users without their knowledge. Spotify was snooping through
						peoples pictures, media files, and contacts. The spying was supposedly being done to provide better advertisements to users.</br>
						Spotify is non-free software so there is no way for people to inspect the software to keep its programmers honest.
						</p><br>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-sm">
						<h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
						<p>In 2013, the documents detailing the United States NSA PRISM surveillance program were leaked. It was discovered that
						the NSA made a deal with Microsoft and other companies to place backdoors in their software. A backdoor is a hole left in software
						security so that it can later be used to gain access to a computer without the users knowledge. Microsoft put these backdoors into
						their product, Windows. Not only can Microsoft or the United States government gain full access to a computer running Windows, it's
						possible that a clever hacker could discover a way to do it too.<br>
						Microsoft Windows is non-free software, so Microsft was able to get away with placing backdoors in their software without anyone
						noticing. Since there is no way for people outside of Microsoft to inspect or modify Windows, there is no way to know whether the
						backdoors still exist, and there is no way to remove them.
